## Installation

Install the React Simple Chatbot package using npm:

```bash
npm install react-simple-chatbot
```

## Usage

1. Import the `ChatBot` component in your React file:

```jsx
import ChatBot from 'react-simple-chatbot';
```

2. Create a chatbot instance with your desired configuration:

```jsx
const steps = [
  { id: '1', message: 'Hello, how can I help you today?', trigger: '2' },
  // Define more steps as needed
];

const SimpleChatbot = () => <ChatBot steps={steps} />;
```

3. Render the chatbot component in your application:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<SimpleChatbot />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Configuration

Customize the chatbot's behavior by configuring steps, messages, and triggers. Refer to the [official documentation](link-to-docs) for detailed configuration options.

Certainly! Below is a README section for the "Issues" part of your code. It explains the issue where the user is asked for input twice:

## Issues with User Input Handling

In the provided code snippet, there is an issue with the user input handling in the "Issues" section. The issue arises from the fact that the user is prompted to input their name in the "AskName" step, and immediately afterward, the input is expected again in the "Name" step.

### Problematic Steps

```jsx
{
  id: "AskName",
  message: "Please enter your name: ",
  trigger: "Name"
},
{
  id: "Name",
  user: true,
  trigger: "Issues"
},
```

In the above steps, the user is asked to enter their name in the "AskName" step, and then the input is expected again in the "Name" step, which seems redundant.
